<!-- const title = document.getElementById('title') 
 title.textContent
 -> output: DOM learning on chai or code
 title.innerHTML
 -> output: DOM learning on chai or code
 title.innerText
 -> output: DOM learning on chai or code

 than what is the difference between them 

 title.innerText -> it gives only that much text which is visible on the screen

 title.textContent -> it gives that much text which is visible but also give the text which is not visible on the screen but is there in the text

 innerHTML -> it gives the inner html means the content + some another HTML tag which is present in the specific tag

 If we have ul and inside it we have li if we want to perform query selector than

 document.querySelector('ul') it will give us an entire ul and its content.

 we can also store it inside the variable
 const myul = document.querySelector('ul')
 myul.querySelector('li') -> it will give us the first li
 const turnGreen = myul.querySelector('li')
  -> after selecting it we can use it same as id and class selector
  we can also give some style to it and many more

 turnGreen.style.backgroundColor = "green"
 turnGreen.style.padding = 10px

 when we use querySelectorAll instead of querySelector than in the output all the list inside ul. 
 The output comes in the form fo NodeList mean all the elements that comes under it.
 the only change we need to do will we apply the style on it is we need to specify the index of it. 
 if we don't specify the index it will give us an error 
 if we want to apply same style on all than we can use for Each loop
  

 The another selector is ByClassName.
 it will give us answer in HTMLCollection -> on this we can't use it in forEach loop so we need to convert it into Array. 
 Array.from(variable) -> it will convert our collection to array and now we can use different method.
