<!-- const title = document.getElementById('title') 
 title.textContent
 -> output: DOM learning on chai or code
 title.innerHTML
 -> output: DOM learning on chai or code
 title.innerText
 -> output: DOM learning on chai or code

 than what is the difference between them 

 title.innerText -> it gives only that much text which is visible on the screen

 title.textContent -> it gives that much text which is visible but also give the text which is not visible on the screen but is there in the text

 innerHTML -> it gives the inner html means the content + some another HTML tag which is present in the specific tag
